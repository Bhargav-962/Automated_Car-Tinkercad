# Automated_Car-Tinkercad
MPCA mini-project on automated car using Arduino UNO on [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), an online 3-D modelling program.  
  
We have used 5 arduino-uno boards and implemented the source code for each separately.  
The layout of the model with connections and codes for the same are included.
